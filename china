    To the citizens of china, You guys need to stand up and fight for your internet ristrictions to be uplifted. Your government is abusing 
  you like a pet owner kicking there pet right in the face. In other places around the world you can go to any place on the internet you 
  want  but on the darkweb, now thats a place you dont need to go. A way for you guys to fix this is find others who want to use features
  on the internet. Also you guys can try to make websites that trick the government to think its a available website and it really be a 
  website based on internet freedom . Make it like a rebellion thing without the govenement knowing. So pretty much what im saying is
  fight for your want for the internet but make sure you dont get caught. good luck
